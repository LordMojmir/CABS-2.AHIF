[[ Multithreading vs Singlethreading ]]

>> Differences between Multithreading and Singlethreading Technologies

A variety of ways have been developed to achieve multitaking on a computer system.
Some of them, for example SMT [which stands for Simultaneous Multithreading' or NUMA [Non-Uniform Memory Access] relies
on having multiple physical processing units, each capable of running independently of the other ones. In most cases, the
processing units are not completely separate CPUs, but cores or threads instead.

On older systems built around a single core, single thread CPU, context switching was heavily relied on. The CPU was frequently
switching between taska to accomplish what appeared to be a multitasking experience.
While this approach worked well enough for the olden times of computing, more resource inventive programs have
proven the advantageg of having multiple physical procesors do the job, instead of creating an illusion of a truly multithreaded system.
