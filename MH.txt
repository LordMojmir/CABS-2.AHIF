since the 60's Multitasing is the standard, before that computer used mostly single tasking, so they would only do one task at a time and not more.

Single Vs Multitasking 

Only can excecute one task at once, so it's much slower. A single Tasking operating system is designed to manage the computer so that one user can effectively do one thing at a time(The Palm OS).
MS-DOS more or less, because you can implement a multitasking software.
